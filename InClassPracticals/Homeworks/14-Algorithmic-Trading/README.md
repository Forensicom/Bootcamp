Step 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset.
To do so, slice your data into different periods. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file.

Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

Increasing or decreasing the training window


Step 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features.
Adjust one or both of the windows for the algorithm. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file.

Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows



Step 3: Choose the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns.
Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns, and document your conclusion in your README.md file.

Tried. Couldn't do it.... Could not figure out how to assign a variable to the plot code.


Step 3: Backtest the new model to evaluate its performance.
Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns for this updated trading algorithm, and write your conclusions in your README.md file.

Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?

This model did not perform as well as the baseline.
