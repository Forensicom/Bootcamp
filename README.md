## League, Inc., A Canadian FinTech Company Revolutionizing the Healthcare Industry

### Background
League, Inc., (www.league.com) was founded June 4, 2014 and incorporated June 12, 2014 by founders Michael Serbinis[^1] , Dan Leibu[^3] and Dan Galperin[^2]. Dan Leibu is the Chief Product & People Officer of League. He had previously served as the CTO at Kobo. Dan Galperin presently serves as the CTO for League, also having worked for Kobo as well. All three operate out of the Toronto, Ontario area.

The founders of League are not new to success. Each of them has an impressive track record of helping to build out companies with greater than $100M dollar exits. In 2009, while still an employee of Indigo, Micheal Serbinis founded Kobo, the Canadian e-reader company. The e-reader was brought to market as a disruptor to the retail book sales industry, of the front end of a consumer shift to reading electronic books. In 2014, with only $31.6M invested, Kobo was sold to Rakuten for $315M[^4]. Michael Serbinis, Dan Galperin and Dan Leibu used the success of the Kobo sale to acquire the funding necessary to launch League, Inc.

The League Board of Directors includes members with extensive experience in the Healthcare sector: 
* Mike Butler, former President of Providence Health
* Michael Palmer, former Chief Innovation and Digital Officer, Aetna
* Carey Grace, former CEO of Aon Human Capital Solutions
* James M. Aquilina, former President, Aon Global Cyber Solutions
* Zoe Phillipides, Chief Ethics, Compliance and Privacy Officer, Moderna
* Leihanne Levesaler, former executive, Workday
* Sarah Ahmad, SVP Health, Shoppers Drug Mart
* Harry L. Leider, Chief Medical Officer and Executive VP, Gelesis
* Katie Doyle, former CEO, Swanson Health Products

Notably, membership on this board includes representation from Canada's largest retail pharmacy company. This is no coincidence, as you will see in this report. Deep integration into retail pharmacy services is part of the near future for League.

### Funding 
League, Inc., was funded by a total of 19 investors, with 4 investors (TDM, OMERS, Workday, Telus) currently serving as leads. 
At the end of 2021, the pre-money valuation of the financing priced League at $850 million USD, or $1.1 billion CAD, making it Canada’s newest tech unicorn. Disclosed funding rounds were as follows:
* Nov 12, 2014 - Received seed funding ($4M) from OMERS Ventures
* Jun 14, 2016 - Received Series A funding ($25M) from OMERS Ventures

* Oct 29, 2019 - Received Corporate Round funding (unannounced) from Workday Ventures
* Dec 31, 2021 - Recevied Received Series C funding ($95M) from TDM Growth Partners\
Total funding received as of January 2, 2022 is $205M. [^4] 

## Business Activities

### Company Mission,  What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
League was created with the intention to become a disruptor to the traditional healthcare benefits industry. At the time League was founded, Healthcare benefits claims were processed using paper forms, postal services, phone calls and even fax machines. A simple claim could take days, or even week to process. The entire processing system was based on unevolved workflows which resulted in an inability to scale services effectively, high claims processing costs, slow turn-arounds, and low levels of customer satisfaction. At the time League was founded it was an industry ripe for disruption.

League's mission is to empower people to live healthier, happier lives everyday. 
League is doing just that by leveraging modern technology to accelerate and simplify access to healthcare service and products for all users. The League platform will simplify and remarkably accelerate access to, and payment for, healthcare services. Much of League's revenue will be dervied from annual recurring revenue thereby maximizing revenue recognition.  

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?\**

The company has targeted three gorups; the Healthcare benefits consumer, the practicioner, and the payer. They are brought together into a single platform where these services can be accessed, tracked and paid for. As of 2022 the annual Healthcare claims market in Canada across 130 Healthcare insurers was about USD 110 billion. This is a substantial industry that has evolved slowly over the last 50 years, failing to keep up with the evolution of communications and electronic security standards. 

To create a lightweight full function tool that supports the healthcare industry is an enormous task, due largely to the complexities of regulatory compliance requirements from jurisdictions around the world. The development of a functional app for mobile devices is not the real challenge behind the delivery of this type of technology. Developing an app that includes the ability to demonstrate global data privacy and security compliance in all aspects of it function is, by far, the biggest and most costly challenge.

This is where League, one of the first companies out of the gate with this type of technology, has a distinct advantage over the market. As competitors awaken to the concept of a mobile healthcare platform, League has already put the necessary time and money into the development of this technology.

Once the platform is built and compliance requirements are integrated into the solution, it can be re-packaged a resold under various labels, at a cost that a competitor cannot match. This is exactly the trend we see now with League. League has shifted focus form being a service platform, to be being a technology provider. Leagues platform has been licenced by several large entities and re-packaged to fit their brand. League's goal is to provide background functionality labelled as "powered by League:". This is attractive to those companies that wish to move forward and modernize their claims, provider, end user and payment technology. The purchaser can also reduce risk and cut costs by transferring that associated to a non-compliant technology to League. 

Strategy (https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3784378/league-profile.pdf)

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?** \
Leagues primary product offerings are as follows: (https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3784378/league-profile.pdf)
& Group Insurance: A-la-carte health insurance products allowing a firm to pick and choose what works for
the teams needs and budget.
* Health Spending Accounts: Spending accounts that provide employees with the ability to spend their
healthcare dollars on routine expenses that fit their specific health needs.
* Lifestyle Spending Accounts: Gives employees the ability to allocate benefit funds to lifestyle expenses
such as gym memberships and massages.
* Health@Work: On site health screenings, flu clinics, group fitness classes, ergonomic assessments and
more provided directly to the workplace.

This company was early to market with a clean, simplified, always available user experience, available as an app on mobile devices. Being early to market allowed them to obtain funding from key players in this space, such as Telus. Now that their platform is complete and stable, they can offer a customized, branded user experience to other healthcare providers. Competitors solutions are not mature enough at this point to compete. For now, League has the advantage of being both well funded and first to the market. Examples of two competitors are [Lumity](https://www.lumity.com/) and [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/). They are new and moving into this same space, however both are US based. (https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3784378/league-profile.pdf)

An example of this advantage in action is an announcement that came out in March 2022. League had announced that it had partnered with Google Cloud. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220322005816/en/League-Announces-Collaboration-with-Google-Cloud this strategic partnership will allow provider to access League technology through the Google Marketplace and and customize it as needed to optimize their customers experience. https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/highmark-health-google-cloud-league-partner-build-digital-front-door

*** **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**\ 
The backend technologies used by League are as follows:
Application and Data: Javascript, JQuery, React, NGINX, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Google Drive, GraphQL, Swift, Google Compute Engine, Objective C, 
League also these utilities: PayPal, Google Maps, Google Analytics, DevOps, GitHub, Git, Docker, npm, Jenkins, PyCharm, Android Studio, ESLint, Docker Compose, Grafana, CircleCl. (https://stackshare.io/league/league)

The third-party applications used to support the League platform are common technologies which are integrated into many types of applications. While leveraging third-party technology to drive the solution gets it to market faster at a lower cost, it does increase the risks often associated to supply chain. Supply chain risks would include a technology moving to end of life, faulty or flawed being added into the League solution, or a cyber attack that leverages the third party solution to gain access to League Inc., data.


## Landscape

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?** \
The company is supporting Healthcare on the consumer, practicioner and insurance sides.


**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?** \ [^2]
This domain has been very slow to evolve, as the regulatory requirements around privacy, and data jurisdiction are difficult to navigate. Generally speaking, the entire Healthcare sector is in the process of migrating from a paper-based claims system to a fully electronic, unified user experience, but is has not happened quickly. The transfer of this sector over to a fully electronic experince has been aligned somewhat with the evolution of cyber security controls. Prior to 2012, no data was safe. The protective technology was not good enough to keep threat actors out. That has recently evolved and the improvements to data security are now at the point where data can be protected, reliably. Now tha it is safe to store healthcare data elecotrnically we can expect to see a big uptick in the pace of this evolution.

**What are the other major companies in this domain?** \
The major players in Canadian Healthcare are Manulife, Canadalife, Sunlife, Blue Cross and GMS.
Companies similar to League in the USA are Practo, Medisafe, and Meru Health.


## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?** \
From platform to Powered by League, capitalizing on Partner relationships to expand.
By February 2020, League was offering its HBX to wealth management and benefits provider Canada Life‘s customers. Months later, the company announced its ‘Powered by League’ partner program to power digital health infrastructure for pharmacies, health systems, and financial institutions.[^3]
By the end of the year, League had partnered with Loblaw Companies to build the grocery giant’s new health-focused app, PC Health (Wittington Ventures is also notably the subsidiary of a holding company owned by the Weston family, which also owns and operates Loblaws). League also signed agreements in 2021 to build the health and benefits and benefits platform for Humana, the third-largest health insurance provider in the United States.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?** \

Some of the traditional metrics in the healthcare claims space are:
* First contact resolution rate
* Provider contracting cycle time
* Claims denial rate
* Claims settlement cycle time
* Medical loss ratio

League would perform well against all of these KPI's. 

League's estimated annual revenue is just over $100M. https://growjo.com/company/League. This is corroborated by the 2022 news that they were declared a tech unicorn with a market value of $1.1Bn. https://www.syscreations.ca/blog/league-becomes-healthcare-unicorn/

## Recommendations
League, Inc., should continue its course of providing customized healthcare platforms to healthcare insurers. As this technology edges it's way into the market League is in a leadership positon having a stable, full featured, and highly customizable product offering. Selling customized solutions to healthcare providers will help to maximize associated revenue, and it will allow the company to focus on innovative add-ons. Essentially, League is evolving to become a sofware company. The trend of moving healthcare to an electronic platform is still on the uptick for the foreseeable future.

There are some indicators that League's future platform features and services will include a virtual medical consultation function. 
League is currently hiring people in Canada and the USA for Virtual Care Nursing positions (https://boards.greenhouse.io/leagueinc), whose primary responsibility will be to interact with PC Health customers. PC Health is based on the League platform and customized for Loblaws. Loblaws owns both PC Health and Shoppers Drug Mart. Recall that one of the board members for League is the SVP of Health for Shoppers Drug Mart. Coincidentally, as of January 1, 2023, drug stores in Ontario were given the authority to prescribe treatment for 13 common medical conditions. This legislative change brings a significant potential for expansion of the drug store business. While it has not been announced, for Shoppers Drug Mart to effectively and quickly scale this medcial consulting service, they would likely leverage the PC Health app to deliver their new virtual diagnosis and prescription service. The League platform is an excellent solution because it is proven, stable and clearly the fastest route to market.  

Going well into the future, League should be investing in the development of features and services that leverage Artifical Intelligence (AI).
Something as simple as a bluetooth connection between a mobile device and a fitness watch, paired with the power of AI can support the cocnept of continuous healthcare. Imagine the potential of pairing this detective technology with an individualized AI instance that knows all of the users medications, and medical history. AI could serve as a means of early dectection and intervention, warning users in advance of an issue. Examples of potential future detections include dection of:
* Low blood sugar
* Onset of a migrain headache
* Oncoming seizure
* Heart rate 
* Oncoming heart attack/arrythmia
* Sleep apnea

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**\
Transitioning users from ad hoc or one-time access to subscription-based services to continuous health monitoring would be a new source of annual recurring revenue for League. This subscription service will bring a signficiant positive impact to company's overall worth. 

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?**\
The core technologies would be a bluetooth enabled fitness watch, a mobile device and an AI stack. The technologies that this technology would need to leverage are already in place. There is nothing net new to produce, other than the service itself. Having the hardware and softwa rein place reduces some of the risk and cost of developing the go to market solution.
