## League, Inc., A Canadian FinTech Company Revolutionizing the Healthcare Industry

### Background
League, Inc., (www.league.com) was founded June 4, 2014 and incorporated June 12, 2014 by founders Michael Serbinis[^1] , Dan Leibu and Dan Galperin[^2]. Dan Leibu[^3] is the Chief Product & People Officer of League. He had previously served as the CTO at Kobo. Dan Galperin presently serves as the CTO for League, also having worked for Kobo as well. All three operate out of the Toronto, Ontario area.

The founders of League are not new to success. Each of them has an impressive track record of helping to build out companies with greater than $100M dollar exits. In 2009, while still an employee of Indigo, Micheal Serbinis founded Kobo, the Canadian e-reader company. The e-reader was brought to market as a disruptor to the retail book sales industry, of the front end of a consumer shift to reading electronic books. In 2014, with only $31.6M invested, Kobo was sold to Rakuten for $315M (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/top-1000/inside-the-kobo-deal-that-netted-indigo-165-million/article4256906/?ref=https://www.theglobeandmail.com&page=all). Michael Serbinis, Dan Galperin and Dan Leibu used the success of the Kobo sale to acquire the funding necessary to launch League, Inc.

## Business Activities

### Company Mission,  What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
League was created to become a disruptor to the traditional healthcare claims industry. At the time League was founded, Healthcare claims were processed using paper forms, postal services, phone calls and even fax machines. A simple claim could take days, or even week to process. The entire processing system was based on unevolved workflows which resulted in an inability to scale services effectively, high claims processing costs, slow turn-arounds, and low levels of customer satisfaction. At the time League was founded it was an industry ripe for disruption.

 


The League platform was created to improve the consumer experience in Healthcare. Their single platform user experience overcomes issues with legacy technologies and disparate systems. 

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?\**

The company has targeted the Healthcare consumer, the provider, and the payer. They are brought together in this single platform.
As of 2022 the annual Healthcare claims market in Canada across 130 Healthcare insurers was about USD 110 billion. This is a large industry that has evolved slowly over th elast 50 years,failing ot keep up withmodern comminucaiotns methods and electronic security standards. To create a lightweight full function tool that supports the healthcare industry is an enormous task, due largely to the complexities of regulatory compliance requirements from jurisdictions around the world. 

The development of a functional app for mobile devices is not the real challenge behind the delivery of this type of technology. Developing an app that includes the ability to demonstrate global data privacy and security compliance in all aspects of it function is, by far, the biggest and most costly challenge.

This is where League, one of the firs tout of the gate with this type of tehcnology, has a distinct advantageover the market. 
Once the platform is built and compliance reuiqrements integrate dinto the solution, it can be re-apacked a resold under various labels, at a cost that a competitor cannot match.
this is exactly the trens we are seeing with LEague, now. League has shifted focus form being a service platform, to be being a technology provider. Leagues platform has been licenced by several larg eentiries and rel packaged to fit their breand. League's goal is to provide backgorund ufnctionality labelled as "powered by League:". Thsi is attratcive to thos eocmpanies that wish to move forward and modernize their claims, provider, end user and payment technology. ther eis also the advantage of off-loaoding th erisk associate to non-compliance. By using th eLEague technology, the proviver effecitvely offloading compliance risks to League, therby cutting annual maintenance costs.

Strategy (https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3784378/league-profile.pdf)

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)**
This company was early to market with a clean, simplified, always available user experience, which is also available as an app on mobile devices. Being early to market allowed them to obtain funding from key players in this space, such as Telus.

Leagues primary product offerings are as follows: (https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3784378/league-profile.pdf)
& Group Insurance: A-la-carte health insurance products allowing a firm to pick and choose what works for
the teams needs and budget.
* Health Spending Accounts: Spending accounts that provide employees with the ability to spend their
healthcare dollars on routine expenses that fit their specific health needs.
* Lifestyle Spending Accounts: Gives employees the ability to allocate benefit funds to lifestyle expenses
such as gym memberships and massages.
* Health@Work: On site health screenings, flu clinics, group fitness classes, ergonomic assessments and
more provided directly to the workplace.

Two competitors, [Lumity](https://www.lumity.com/) and [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/) are also moving into this same space, however both are US based. (https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3784378/league-profile.pdf)



*** **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** ******(This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)\
The technologies used by League are as follows:
Application and Data: Javascript, JQuery, React, NGINX, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Google Drive, GraphQL, Swift, Google Compute Engine, Objective C, 
Utilities: PayPal, Google Maps, Google Analytics, DevOps, GitHub, Git, Docker, npm, Jenkins, PyCharm, Android Studio, ESLint, Docker Compose, Grafana, CircleCl
Business tools: Slack, Jira, GSuite, Salesforce (https://stackshare.io/league/league)

The third-party applications used to support the League platform are common technologies which are integrated into many types of applications. While leveraging third-party technology to drive the solution gets it to market faster at a lower cost, it does increase the risks often associated to supply chain. Supply chain risks would include a technology moving to end of life, faulty or flawed being added into the League solution, or a cyber attack that leverages the third party solution to gain access to League Inc., data.

By the end of the year, League had partnered with Loblaw Companies to build the grocery giant’s new health-focused app, PC Health (Wittington Ventures is also notably the subsidiary of a holding company owned by the Weston family, which also owns and operates Loblaws). League also signed agreements in 2021 to build the health and benefits and benefits platform for Humana, the third-largest health insurance provider in the United States.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**




**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**






## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

First a patient/doctor interaction forum. Video appoitnemnts, discuusion, comms. entire platform.

The company should explore leveraging their app as a marketing platform for Products and services related to Healthcare. 
Medcial aids indistry is worth XXXXX
Mental Health industry is XXXXXXXXX
Fitness XXXXXXX

The value in league is not only the ocmmnuicaitons tehcnology, but also the raw user data. the more raw user activity date, the more valuable League becomes. 
since League is closoely tied to Healthcare they may wish to explore prevention, detection and diagnosis technology.
Something as simple as a bluetooth connection betwene a mobile device and a fitness watch can deliver the following outcomes:

* Low blood sugar
* Onset of a migrain headache
* Oncoming seizure
* Heart rate 
* Oncoming heart attack/arrythmia
* Sleep apnea
*
Imagine the potential of pairing this detective technology with an individualized AI instance that knows all of the individuals medications, conditions and ailments. 
AI could serve as a means of early intervention, wanring users in advance of an issue.
Raw health telemetry tied to a specific user is invaluable to not only the user, but also medical practicioners and insurers.

Also think about telemedicine

Delivering ads via the app is a great way to target users
